# Reinforcement Learning Autonomous Driving
Reinforcement Learning Project for making a car drive autonomously in a race track with the help of a game

PPO algorithm is used for this project. 
There are two saved models in this repository. One with 100k timesteps and one with 500k timesteps. These both can be compared, but more the timesteps, the better will be the model. 

100K Timesteps Learning gave a reward mean of 358.2783729761839 and a standard deviation of 248.08073760518528<br>
500K Timesteps Learning gave a reward mean of 426.0350626245141 and a standard deviation of 229.46517291166742
